                <h3 >GENERAL RELATIVITY &amp; COSMOLOGY</h3>
<p>for Undergraduates Professor John W. Norbury</p>

<p>This book written by Professor John Norbury explains general relativity and concepts of cosmology in a clear way and focuses on introducing these subjects at an undergraduate level.
Professor John Norburyâ€™s research interests are in the areas of theoretical nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. He did his post-doctoral work at NASA Langley Research Center on the problem of protecting astronauts from cosmic radiation. He has continued doing contract work for NASA ever since, and is responsible for calculating the effects of certain nuclear and particle reactions that occur when a cosmic ray particle hits a spacecraft wall. He has worked on a variety of research problems including electromagnetic interactions in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, Higgs boson and graviton production in nuclear collisions, relativistic quark models and certain problems in cosmology and quantum gravity. 
Apart from this book, he has published many books on quantum mechanics and quantum field theory for undergraduates.</p>

<h3>Quarks,leptons and the big bang</h3>

<p>Quarks, leptons and the big bang is a clear, readable and self contained introduction to particle physics and related areas of cosmology. It bridges the gap between non technical popular accounts and textbooks for advanced students. The book concentrates on presenting the subject from the modern perspective or quarks, leptons and the forces between them.This approach enables readers to grasp the essential concepts more easily than the traditional historical approach involving the complex interaction of hadrons. It then moves on to applying these ideas to modern cosmology.</p>

<h3>The Exploration of Near-Earth Objects</h3>

<p>Comets and asteroids are in some sense the fossils of the solar system. They have avoided most of the drastic physical processing that shaped the planets and thus represent more closely the properties of the primordial solar nebula. What processing has taken place is itself of interest in decoding the history of our solar neighborhood. Near-Earth objects are also of interest because one or more large ones have been blamed for the rare but devastating events that caused mass extinctions of species on our planet, as attested by recent excitement over the impending passage of asteroid 1997 XF11. The comets and asteroids whose orbits bring them close to Earth are clearly the most accessible to detailed investigation, both from the ground and from spacecraft. When nature kindly delivers the occasional asteroid to the surface of Earth as a meteorite, we can scrutinize it closely in the laboratory; a great deal of information about primordial chemical composition and primitive processes has been gleaned from such objects.
This report reviews the current state of research on near-Earth objects and considers future directions. Atten-
tion is paid to the important interplay between ground-based investigations and spaceborne observation or sample collection and return. This is particularly timely since one U.S. spacecraft is already on its way to rendezvous with a near-Earth object, and two others plus a Japanese mission are being readied for launch. In addition to scientific issues, the report considers technologies that would enable further advances in capability and points out the possibilities for including near-Earth objects in any future expansion of human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.</p>

<h3>The Foundations Of Celestial Mechanics</h3>

<p>This book covers classical mechanics from the very basics and then proceeds to celestial mechanics covering 2 body problems and dynamics of more than two bodies. Basics of perturbation theory are also covered.</p>
